# Zoomicon.Cache.Delphi
Content Cache for Delphi

Originated in the context of the [READ-COM Application](https://github.com/Zoomicon/READCOM_App) project for use with [Zoomicon.Downloader.Delphi](https://github.com/Zoomicon/Zoomicon.Downloader.Delphi)
Currently not used in READ-COM App.

Test cases not implemented yet, but test cases in the Downloader project that make use of Cache do pass, so feel free to use/experiment with the caching mechanism.

## Usage
Can opt to install via [Boss Package Manager](https://github.com/HashLoad/boss/releases/latest) (you can use [Boss Experts](https://getitnow.embarcadero.com/boss-experts/) from GetIt to see a UI for it in the IDE).

You just need to add as dependency the GitHub site's url: [https://github.com/Zoomicon/Zoomicon.Cache.Delphi](https://github.com/Zoomicon/Zoomicon.Cache.Delphi)
